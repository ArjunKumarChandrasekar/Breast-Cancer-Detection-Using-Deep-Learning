# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
Breast cancer is a prevalent disease that requires early detection for positive outcomes. Deep learning, a type of machine learning using neural networks, can analyze medical images such as mammograms to detect suspicious patterns indicating cancer. This improves diagnosis accuracy, leading to earlier treatment and better outcomes for patients.
